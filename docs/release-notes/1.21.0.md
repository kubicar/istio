## Istio Updated to Version 1.26.2

We've updated the Istio version to 1.26.2 ([#1503](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/pull/1503)).
Read the [Istio 1.26.2 release announcement](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.26.x/announcing-1.26.2/) as well
as [Istio 1.26.0 release announcement](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.26.x/announcing-1.26/).

## New Features

- The Istio module now supports installation with Istio images injected into the installer from environment variables. This allows for more flexible deployments, especially in environments where images are not available in a public registry. See [issue #1519](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1519).

## Fixed Bugs

- We've fixed a bug where the `proxy-protocol` EnvoyFilter applied by the Istio module on AWS clusters with ELB load balancers was incorrectly detected as a user resource. This resulted in the Istio custom resource being set to the `Warning` state. See [#1491](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1491).
- We've fixed a bug where labels of the Istio managed resources were not correctly reconciled. See [#1523](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1523).
- We've fixed a bug where the `app.kubernetes.io/version` label was not set to the proper version in the managed resources. See [#1523](https://github.com/kyma-project/istio/issues/1523).
